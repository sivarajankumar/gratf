**GRATF** stands for Glyph Recognition And Tracking Framework. The project is aimed to provide a library which does localization, recognition and pose estimation of optical glyphs in still images and video files. The library can be used in robotics applications for example, where glyphs may serve as commands or directions to robots. However, most popular application of optical glyph recognition is augmented reality.

Here are few demos of what this project can do:
